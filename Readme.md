# Basic shell in C
This shell is completely built in C.

It supports commands such as `pwd`,` cd`,`echo`,`ls`, `bg`, `fg`, `kjob`, `overkill`, `exit`, `pinfo` etc.
There is also flag support so for `ls` you can use the flags `-l` and `-a`.
It also supports running background commands by entering & at the end of that command.
It also supports multiple commands in one line by separating each command by a semicolon.


## To Run
- Open terminal at that particular folder.
- Run make; ./shell
